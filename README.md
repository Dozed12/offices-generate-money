# offices-generate-money
Offices generate money mod for Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic.

New features:
1. Offices now generate services, not money. Services act as a consumer good and you can trade it.
2. Your population demands services. If you don't have enough of them, you import them, otherwise you can export them. If you don't have money to import them, there are nasty consequences, such as decreasing happiness and loyalty, increasing criminality and random fires.
3. Education level of your citizens influences the amount of created services.
4. The amount of imported/exported services influences their price (included a simulation Excel file to see how it works).
5. Visualisation of internal supply and demand, current price of services and daily balance.
6. Settings file allows you to easily configure the mod to make it harder or easier or enable/disable some features. They shouldn't cause any problems when you change them during your game, but remember to restart the script.

This mod aims to give office buildings some actual use. With this script each city hall generates some amount of services. Services work as a kind of consumer good, needed by your citizens. If you do not have enough of them, you have to import them, on the other hand, if you generate excess services, you can export them abroad and make money.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left hand side of the screen and choose the version you prefer (trading in rubles, in dollars, or both of them). You can also turn the script off.

This requires further testing and balancing. It seems to work, but I haven't tested it extensively :P Most importantly, inflation is properly taken into account only if you do not use any scripts, cheats or external tools to change the game date after you have enabled the script. In particular, you should set your starting year in the settings.txt file for correct inflation calculation and grace period. 

Warnings: If you reload your game without quitting the game or at least returning to the main menu, they script will be duplicated. If this happens, simply run the turn off script until you are only running one instance.

The mods is not compatible with other script mods using objectives (it will clear them every few seconds).

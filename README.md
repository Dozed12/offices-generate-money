# offices-generate-money
Offices generate money mod for Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic.

This is a small side project which may give office buildings some actual use. With this script each city hall adds a small stream of money proportional to the number of workers. You can choose if you want rubles, dollars or both at halved rates (they are mutually exclusive, enabling one disables the others). Some office mods are recommended for diversity, but it also works with the vanilla one.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left hand side of the screen and choose the script you prefer. You can also turn the money generation off.

This requires further testing and balancing. It seems to work, but I haven't tested it extensively :P Most importantly, inflation is properly taken into account only if you do not use any scripts, cheats or external tools to change the game date after you have enabled the script. The start year is set to 1960 by default, you can change it in Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\2950484463\include\office_money.txt. Constant yearly inflation rates of 1.1 for rubles and 1.03 for dollars are assumed, as well as compound interest with yearly capitalization.

Warning: if you reload your game without quitting the game or at least returning to the main menu, they script will be duplicated. If this happens, simply run the turn off script until you are only running one instance.

$ITEM_DESC "This mod aims to give office buildings some actual use. With this script, each city hall generates some amount of services. Services work as a kind of consumer good, needed by your citizens. If you do not have enough of them, you have to import them, on the other hand, if you generate excess services, you can export them abroad and make money.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left-hand side of the screen and choose the version you prefer (trading in rubles, in dollars, or both of them). You can also turn the script off.
